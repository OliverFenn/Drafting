# angle.py
"""
This is a function to be used with graphics.py
This function allows to calculate the angle on a pole by giving coordinates
Inputs:
  pole1 - an array with an [x,y] coordinate of the center of the pole to be
            drawn.
  pole2 - an array with an [x,y] coordinate of the center of the pole to be
            drawn.
Outputs:
  angle: the angle on a pole in degrees
